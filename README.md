#The Problem Space

While researching about the stigma behind talking openly about mental health issue, we found that some major problems that people face are: fear and shame of feeling weak, lack of awareness even with abundant resources, and the lack of a community who share the same problems to discuss these issues.

#How we tackle it
WATHealth aims to tackle all these problems by offering complete **anonymity** by default, using Natural Language Processing Tools like the **Watson API** to examine the content a user interacts with to understand if a user needs immediate help, a unique **Buddy** system where users are assigned a random partner who shares the same problems to discuss their issues and help each other. We also offer ready **resources** on our page for users and an emergency **Get Help!** button to get immediate assistance. Users can also talk directly to our representatives from a **Contact Us** button

#What are the problems with existing solutions?
Stigma behind openly talking about mental health issues with the lack of awareness and readily available resources. Lack of a community to share problems with no direct connection to professionals.

#How are we special
This is completely free with no hidden costs while it is 100% anonymous. A unique 'buddy' system to assign people to partners for support. A community of people who share the same issues. Directly sending your data to professionals and using the power of data. 

#Future Additions

##Doctor Connect 
Directly sending all of your data from surveys and the content you interact with to medical professionals who can help. 

##In-House message platform
Create an on-platform messaging service to incorporate an added level of privacy and also so you can be able to monitor those messages for keywords that indicate needing immediate help.

##Post Filtering.
Incorporated an automatic post filtering system which removes obscene words and troll users. Used NLP and keyword search to accomplish this.  

#Installation

To run this, you will need to ```npm install``` and have view installed.

It becomes easiest when you have the LiveServer extension in vscode.
