It makes me extremely uncomfortable to have random people knowing my whole story without me even meeting them. I don't know what to do, and when confronted, my family will just tell me that it's their business to share, because my mental health affects them too. It's extremely frustrating...",

    comment: "I'm in my early 50s. I'm not suicidal. I actually fear death more than almost anything else in this world, however, I feel like my life isn't valuable to anyone or anything, other than myself. I feel like all I am doing is taking up space on this planet and using up limited resources. In short, I feel guilty just for living.    My question is, how do I change this? What can I do to make myself valuable? Is it even possible anymore? I have no children. No mate. Not many friends. I keep mostly to myself and to be honest, I don't like being around others much anyway. Most of the other people I'm around are just as ugly as I am, so socializing is not much fun. Life is unpleasant and I mostly lay in bed all day or else vegetate in front of the computer. I live with my parents so I can do that for now but my parents are elderly and it worries me what will happen when they are gone.  I feel stuck and I can't even muster the will to lift a finger to do anything about all this. I just want to sit here and watch my life cave in. It's all I want to do anymore. It sort of feels like the right thing to do--like this is what I deserve, to sit here and passively watch as my world gradually falls apart around me.",

    comment: "Hello everyone.  Not having the best start to the new year. I was in temp employment as a receptionist but the work has dried up and I was supposed to be starting somewhere else but that role got cancelled so I am unemployed now with zero income and no entitlement to benefits.   Also my gran died a few days ago and the funeral is soon. So I've been feeling pretty rubbish about that.   I just honestly don't feel like doing much. I was struggling with anxiety before Christmas due to my finances but I just don't have the motivation to do anything about it now. I'm also studying a course online and can only just manage to study the bear minimum of that before I feel exhausted by everything.  I was only working part time before in an undemanding job but since that finished I feel soo much more tired than I did when I had to get out my bed early. I was wanting to try get into a routing of getting up early so my sleep patterns could be better, but now I don't even care if I'm sleeping in middle of the day.   If sucks feeling like this ðŸ˜”",
